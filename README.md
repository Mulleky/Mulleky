- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mulleky
- 👀 I’m interested in aerospace, mechanical engineering, and how we can merge them with coding to come up with design and characterization tools
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python to then apply in analysis of propulsion systems (airbreathing engines and rocket engines in the future)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on STEM projects to increase my skills, meet people and do great things with coding
- 📫 How to reach me LinkedIn: Carlos Torre, carlostorresada@gmail.com
